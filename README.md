## Title-Demand Forecasting of Air Conditioning for Commercial Complex

Given one-year hourly energy consumption data of a client's commercial complex ( Office space), you need to estimate the future energy demand - hourly, daily 
Suitable Forecasting Algorithms need to be used.              

1. Knowledge of machine learning                            
2. To learn programming languages, HTML, Angular JS, Python etc.              
3. Data preprocessing - Cleaning, missing data, outliers removal, normalization etc.             
4. Feature Engineering, Identification of right algorithm for forecasting, Python Implementation               
5. Development Front end, application deployment, testing and results validation
